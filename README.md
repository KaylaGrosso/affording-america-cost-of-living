# affording-america-cost-of-living
 Final capstone project analyzing cost-of-living across U.S. counties using Python and Tableau to assess regional affordability for working families.
# Capstone 2 – Affording America: A Cost-of-Living Analysis 🏡📉

## 📊 Overview
This capstone project investigates the cost of living across the United States, with a focus on affordability for families based on income-to-expense ratios. It uses Python for data analysis and Tableau for dynamic data visualization. The project follows a structured approach: problem framing, exploratory analysis, and multi-audience storytelling through visualizations.

## 💡 SMART Problem Statement
How affordable is the average American county for families earning median household income, and which regions show the most favorable affordability ratios?

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Wide variability exists in affordability ratios by state and county.
- Some counties with high median incomes still fall short on affordability due to elevated cost-of-living indices.
- States with generally lower income levels (e.g., Mississippi) may still rank more affordable based on relative expense.
